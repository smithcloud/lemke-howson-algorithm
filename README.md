## Lemke–Howson algorithm
The Lemke–Howson algorithm is an algorithm that computes a Nash equilibrium of a bimatrix game, named after its inventors, Carlton E. Lemke and J. T. Howson. It is said to be “the best known among the combinatorial algorithms for finding a Nash equilibrium”.

## Properties of the algorithm
The algorithm can find at most *n + m* different Nash equilibria. Any choice of initially-dropped label determines the equilibrium that is eventually found by the algorithm.
